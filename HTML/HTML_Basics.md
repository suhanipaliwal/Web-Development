## HTML 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension. There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.
